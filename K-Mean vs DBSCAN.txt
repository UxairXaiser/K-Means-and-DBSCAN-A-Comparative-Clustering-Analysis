Comparison: K-Means vs. DBSCAN
K-Means Clustering:
Assumptions & Requirements:
Requires you to specify the number of clusters (K) in advance.
Best suited for spherical (globular) clusters.
Sensitive to outliers since it minimizes the sum-of-squares error.
Advantages:
Speed and Scalability: Works efficiently on large datasets.
Simplicity: Conceptually simple and easy to implement.
When It Performs Better:
When clusters are well-separated and roughly equal in size.
When you have little to no noise in the data.
DBSCAN Clustering:
Assumptions & Requirements:
Does not require specifying the number of clusters upfront.
Groups points based on density; clusters can be arbitrarily shaped.
Automatically identifies outliers as noise (labelled as -1).
Advantages:
Flexibility: Handles clusters of various shapes and sizes.
Robustness to Noise: Outliers are naturally excluded from clusters.
When It Performs Better:
When the data has clusters with irregular shapes or non-globular patterns.
In scenarios where noise and outliers are significant.
Considerations:
The performance of DBSCAN heavily depends on choosing the right eps (radius) and min_samples parameters.
It can struggle with datasets where the density varies significantly among clusters.
Summary
K-Means is typically a good choice when you know the approximate number of clusters, the clusters are spherical, and you need a fast, scalable method.
DBSCAN is preferable when you expect clusters of arbitrary shape, when your data contains noise or outliers, or when you are unsure about the number of clusters.
By implementing both methods, you can compare their results visually (and quantitatively, using metrics like silhouette score) to decide which clustering method best suits your customer segmentation needs.
